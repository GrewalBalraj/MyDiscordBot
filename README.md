# MyDiscordBot
A Discord bot I made to provide moderation for a discord server, as well as provide entertainment and information commands to users of a server. These commands include the ability to ask the bot for things such as:

  - Trivia questions
  - The current weather in a city
  - A description of an anime (or manga or character).
  - Which pokemon is associated with a specific number
